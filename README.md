#BookNiche

Overview:

BookNiche is a book resource app which enables students of the institute to borrow and lend books from/to the fellow students. Institute library doesn’t always comprise of a wide range of books in which students have interest. Also in the growing institute like ours, there’s a lot of problems in library management and the range/variety of books available. So BookNiche platform will enable the students to make a niche/bookshelf of their own on the platform which will give students the option to view the variety of books owned by different students and can directly borrow or lend from/to them via the platform.

Goals:

* Create a niche of books by students on the platform(app).
* Enable students to borrow and lend books directly via the platform(app).

Specifications:

* The app will enable a student to create his/her own account on it.
* A user will then have a shelf of his own, option to view the shelf of others, search option for searching the book & contact the person   directly via app.
* User can add the books owned by him in his shelf & view others’ shelves.
* When a book is borrowed/lent, there’ll be an entry of book along with details of borrower & lender in the seperate sheet, that can be     viewed by each person.
* One can also request the book in advance (in case it is already borrowed by someone & person doesn’t want to take a chance)
* Admin will have a different account in which he/she can keep a track of all the activities & prevent the negative use of the platform.
